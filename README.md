# Web3 Password Manager

This project demonstrates a proof of concept password manager built on Web3.
Notably, this doesn't support many of the server interactions you'd expect with a production password manager.

## Disclaimers

The passwords generated by this have not been verified to be sufficiently random.
As such they may have a tendency to not be well distributed, or favor certain characters over others.
Besides that, the passwords are generated from a common signature that you could be tricked into recreating or accidentally leaked.

## How it works

The application asks your wallet to sign a consistent message on each subsequent login.
Using the resulting signature, the application generates a new hash from the domain you are trying to login to.
This hash is projected onto a set of characters to build the desired password.

This process is idempotent and given the same base signature, input domain, and character set, should produce the same password.
Using this, we can generate a password without relying on server interactions.

# Drawbacks

Because the application isn't backed by a server and only has access to your wallet, it can't store custom values.
Everything is generated on the fly and relies on receiving the same output for the given output.

This means it can't store which sites you have passwords for.
Additionally, it can't store the settings you have generated passwords with.
Lastly, it can't store the username you logged in with.
